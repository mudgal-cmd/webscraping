Web Scraping Using Selenium

The project scrapes data from Yahoo Finance, which lists the current stock price of various commodities.

The name of the commodity along with the current price is stored in a text file.

Simultanously, the same information is being stored in the sqlite3 database. 

Note that both the text files and the database files will be re-created everytime the program is executed, i.e., if any/both of the files are present, they will be deleted and a new file will be created in place of them.
